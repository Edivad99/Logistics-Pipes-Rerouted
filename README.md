# Logistic Pipes 2

A revival of [Logistics Pipes](https://github.com/RS485/LogisticsPipes), ported from Forge 1.12.2 to **NeoForge 1.20.1** — bringing the classic request-based item routing, automated crafting, and modular chassis pipes back to modern Minecraft.

See the original [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/logistics-pipes) for background on what the mod has been since its 1.4.x days.

> **Beta / work in progress.** Expect bugs, crashes, missing polish, and the occasional broken feature. Back up your worlds before testing, and please open an issue if something goes wrong — noisy reports are more useful than silent frustration.

## Forge or NeoForge?

**Both — on this Minecraft version they are the same platform.** NeoForge's 1.20.1 release was its first after forking from Forge and is fully Forge-compatible (it even ships under the `forge` id). The released jar runs unchanged on:

- **Forge 1.20.1** — 47.2.x / 47.3.x from [files.minecraftforge.net](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.20.1.html)
- **NeoForge 1.20.1** — 47.1.x, e.g. the [1.20.1-47.1.106 installer](https://maven.neoforged.net/#/releases/net/neoforged/forge/1.20.1-47.1.106)

The split only matters from Minecraft **1.20.2 onward**, where NeoForge changed its internals — this jar will not run there (you get a clean "requires Minecraft 1.20.1" screen instead). The planned 1.21.x version of this mod targets NeoForge proper.

**Required dependency:** [Kotlin for Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kotlin-for-forge) **4.x** (the 1.20.1 file) — the mod will not load without it.

## What is Logistic Pipes

A logistics mod that lets you build pipe networks capable of requesting items on demand, automatically sorting inventory, and triggering crafting chains. Pipes connect to any inventory and route items intelligently based on your configured rules — no constant item flow, no lost items, just point-to-point delivery driven by what you ask for.

<!-- TODO: add a screenshot or short GIF of a network in action -->

## Status

Work in progress, but **feature-complete vs LP 1.12.2 upstream**. The migration ported the full 1014-file LP1 `dev` source to NeoForge 1.20.1; only 18 1.12.2-only legacy files (ASM coremods, OreDict recipe conditions, old `IGuiHandler` API, naming-collision utility classes) are intentionally not ported — each of those is either superseded by a modern equivalent (Mixins instead of coremod ASM, Tags instead of OreDict) or removed because the integrated mod doesn't exist on 1.20.1.

Core gameplay (placing pipes, routing, requesting, chassis modules, crafting) is fully functional. Polish and third-party integrations are the main outstanding work. See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for a detailed checkpoint and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for recent changes.

## Known Limitations

- **Mod integrations disabled** — BuildCraft, IndustrialCraft 2, Thermal Dynamics, NEI, and similar integrations are stubbed out; most are waiting on upstream ports to 1.20.1.
- **Items-in-transit rendering** — visible but still being polished.
- **SideConfigDisplay** — not yet functional.
- **No world upgrade path from 1.12.2 saves** — legacy data fixers are not ported; start on a 1.20.1 world.

## Planned

- Fabric support via [Architectury](https://docs.architectury.dev/) (after the NeoForge 1.20.1 port reaches feature parity)
- Published API jar so addons can be built against a stable surface
- Performance improvements (render caching, dirty-flag system)

## Versions

- Minecraft **1.20.1** (only — see "Forge or NeoForge?" above)
- Forge **47.2+** / NeoForge **47.1.x** (built against 47.1.88)
- Kotlin for Forge **4.x** (runtime dependency for players)
- Java **17** (provisioned automatically via Gradle toolchains)
- Kotlin **1.9.10**

## Building

```bash
./gradlew build         # full build; output in build/libs/
./gradlew runClient     # launch a dev client
./gradlew runServer     # launch a dev server
./gradlew check         # unit tests
```

Requires `git-lfs` for a small number of LFS-tracked JARs. If you cloned without it:

```bash
git lfs install && git lfs fetch && git lfs checkout
```
